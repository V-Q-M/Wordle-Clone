# Wordle-Clone in C/C++

This is my version of wordle, written entirely in C/C++.
It is my first C++ project and uses OpenGL for the GUI.
Currently only CLI is supported, but a GUI is on it's way.

## Installation

Download the binary of your choice, make it runnable with
`chmod +x 777` and run it with `./wordle`.

Alternatively clone the repo and run the makefile with
`make`
Then start the game with
`./build/wordle`
